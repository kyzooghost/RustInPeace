// Scheduling. Write a program SPT.java that reads job names and processing times from standard input and prints a schedule that minimizes average completion time using the shortest processing time first rule, as described on page 349.

// Schedule jobs in increasing order of processing time
// This is just putting jobs on a minPQ, so it's trivial to implement imo, better to understand the context

// Job scheduling problem
// Minimise average flowtime
// Shortest processing time first
