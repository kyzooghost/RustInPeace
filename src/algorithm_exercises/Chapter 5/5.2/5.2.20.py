'''
Contains prefix. Add a method containsPrefix() to StringSET (see Exercise 5.2.6) that takes a string s as input and returns true if there is a string in the set that contains s as a prefix.

Similar to 'keysWithPrefix'
Actually one way to implement containsPrefix() is check if len(keysWithPrefix > 0)
Another way is to perform search up to prefix, and see if there is any non-null extension to the prefix
