Spell checking. Write a TST client SpellChecker that takes as command-line argument the name of a file containing a dictionary of words in the English language, and then reads a string from standard input and prints out any word that is not in the dictionary. Use a string set.

Enter each word in the dictionary into the TST
Call TST.contains() on every word you want to spellcheck - O(N) time complexity where N is the length of the word
