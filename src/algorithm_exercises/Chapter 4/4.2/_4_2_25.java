// Unique topological ordering. 

// Design an algorithm to determine whether a digraph has a unique topological ordering. 

// Hint: A digraph has a unique topological ordering if and only if there is a directed edge between each pair of consecutive vertices in the topological order (i.e., the digraph has a Hamiltonian path). If the digraph has multiple topological orderings, then a second topological order can be obtained by swapping a pair of consecutive vertices.

// Err, this question is already answered by 4.2.24, just check if there is a Hamilton path through the digraph.
