// Hamiltonian path in DAGs. Given a DAG, design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether there is a directed path that visits each vertex exactly once.

// Answer: Compute a topological sort and check if there is an edge between each consecutive pair of vertices in the topological order.

// Topological sort
// Check if edge between each pair along topological sort
