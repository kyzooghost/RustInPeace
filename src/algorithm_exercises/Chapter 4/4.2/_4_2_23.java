// Strong component. Describe a linear-time algorithm for computing the strong connected component containing a given vertex v. On the basis of that algorithm, describe a simple quadratic algorithm for computing the strong components of a digraph.

// Every digraph is a DAG of its strongly connected components
// Strongly connected component must be a cycle
// So use DFS to find if a cycle involving vertex v exists => The strongly connected component consists of vertices in the cycle path
// Quadratic algorithm - above iterated for each vertex v
