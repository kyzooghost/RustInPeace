// Give a counterexample that shows why the following strategy does not necessarily find the MST: ‘Start with any vertex as a single-vertex MST, then add V-1 edges to it, always taking next a min-weight edge incident to the vertex most recently added to the MST.’

// It may not work if the next min-weight edge is not between cuts, and creates a cycle
