// Prove the following, known as the cycle property: Given any cycle in an edge- weighted graph (all edge weights distinct), the edge of maximum weight in the cycle does not belong to the MST of the graph.

// If there is a cycle in an edge-weighted graph, then the maximum weight edge and another edge in the cycle will be two 'competing' edges for two cuts. The other edge will be chosen by definition, hence the maximum weight edge won't be in the MST.
