// Suppose that a graph has distinct edge weights. Does its shortest edge have to belong to the MST? Can its longest edge belong to the MST? Does a min-weight edge on every cycle have to belong to the MST? Prove your answer to each question or give a counterexample.

// Shortest edge does have to belong to MST, because it will be always be chosen out of competing edges between two cuts
// Longest edge can belong to the MST, if it is the only edge connecting two cuts
