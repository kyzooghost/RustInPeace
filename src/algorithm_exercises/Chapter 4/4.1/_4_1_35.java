// A graph is biconnected if every pair of vertices is connected by two disjoint paths. An articulation point in a connected graph is a vertex that would disconnect the graph if it (and its adjacent edges) were removed. Prove that any graph with no articulation points is biconnected. 

// Hint : Given a pair of vertices s and t and a path connecting them, use the fact that none of the vertices on the path are articulation points to construct two disjoint paths connecting s and t.

// Biconnected - every pair of vertices is connected by two disjoint paths (two paths between two vertices, that don't share an edge)
// Articulation point - will disconnect the graph if it and adjacent edges were removed

// If no articulation points
// => Cannot remove any one point and lose connecting path between vertex
// => Cannot have a single path between two vertices
// => Must be bijoint or more
