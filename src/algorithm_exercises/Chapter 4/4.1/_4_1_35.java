// A graph is biconnected if every pair of vertices is connected by two disjoint paths. An articulation point in a connected graph is a vertex that would disconnect the graph if it (and its adjacent edges) were removed. Prove that any graph with no articulation points is biconnected. Hint : Given a pair of vertices s and t and a path connecting them, use the fact that none of the vertices on the path are articulation points to construct two disjoint paths connecting s and t.
