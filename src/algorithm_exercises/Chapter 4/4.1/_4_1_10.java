// 4.1.10 

// Prove that every connected graph has a vertex whose removal (including all adjacent edges) will not disconnect the graph, and write a DFS method that finds such a vertex. Hint : Consider a vertex whose adjacent vertices are all marked.

// In a connected graph, every pair of vertex has an edge
// So if you remove a vertex and all adjacent edges, every edge connecting vertices excluding the removed vertex, remains. Hence graph will remain connected
