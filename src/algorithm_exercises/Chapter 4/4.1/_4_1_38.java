// Implement the flood fill operation on the implicit graph defined by connecting adjacent points that have the same color in an image.

// Represent image as x by y matrix
// Each pixel is a graph vertex
// Edge between adjacent pixels sharing same colour code
// Find # of connected graphs in this matrix => How many empty-stack DFS calls do we make?
