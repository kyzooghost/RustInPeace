// The girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle.If a graph is acyclic,then its girth is infinite. Add a method girth() to GraphProperties that returns the girth of the graph. Hint : Run BFS from each vertex. The shortest cycle containing s is a shortest path from s to some vertex v, plus the edge from v back to s.

// In BFS, if visited and not marked edge, is cycle
