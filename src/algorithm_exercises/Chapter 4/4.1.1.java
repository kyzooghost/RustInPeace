// What is the maximum number of edges in a graph with V vertices and no parallel edges? What is the minimum number of edges in a graph with V vertices, none of which are isolated?

// Maximum number of edges in a graph with V vertices and no parallel edges
// => Each vertex has a connection to every other vertex
// => V * (V - 1) / 2

// Minimum number of edges in a graph with V vertices, none of which are isolated
// => (V - 1) edges
