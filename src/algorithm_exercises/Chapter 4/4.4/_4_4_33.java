 * Shortest path in a grid. Given an N-by-N matrix of positive integers, find the shortest path from the (0, 0) entry to the (N-1, N-1) entry, where the length of the path is the sum of the integers in the path. Repeat the problem but assume you can only move right and down.
 * 
 * Create a graph with each matrix entry as a node
 * Every node has an outedge to adjacent nodes, with weight = matrix entry value
