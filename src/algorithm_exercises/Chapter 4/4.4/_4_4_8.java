/*
 * The diameter of a digraph is the length of the maximum-length shortest path connecting two vertices. Write a DijkstraSP client that finds the diameter of a given EdgeWeightedDigraph that has nonnegative weights.
 * 
 * Maximum-length shortest path? Isn't there only one shortest path?
 * Ahh got it, run Dijkstra from each vertex as a source, find the largest distTo[] entry.
