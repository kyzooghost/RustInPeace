 * Vertex weights. Show that shortest-paths computations in edge-weighted di- graphs with nonnegative weights on vertices (where the weight of a path is defined to be the sum of the weights of the vertices) can be handled by building an edge-weighted digraph that has weights on only the edges.
 * 
 * You can convert any graph with the schema described above, to a graph with weights on the edges. Once you know you can do that, you're free to apply classic Djistra's algorithm to find the SPT.
 * 
 * Convert every weighted node with two nodes and an edge, the edge going between these two nodes has the weight of the edge, and any other edge (not between the two nodes for a weighted node) has a weight of 0.
