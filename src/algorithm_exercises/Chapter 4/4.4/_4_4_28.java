 * Longest paths in DAGs. Develop an implementation AcyclicLP that can solve the longest-paths problem in edge-weighted DAGs, as described in Proposition T.
 * Negate the edge weights.
 * Relax in topological order of DAG => Find shortest path in DAG in O(E+V) time.
 * If you negate edge weights, shortest path will become the longest (largest distTo[] value), visa versa
