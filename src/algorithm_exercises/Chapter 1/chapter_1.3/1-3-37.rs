// 1.3.37 Josephus problem. 
// In the Josephus problem from antiquity, 
// N people are in dire straits and agree to the following strategy to reduce the population. 
// They arrange themselves in a circle (at positions numbered from 0 to Nâ€“1) and proceed around the circle, 
// eliminating every Mth person until only one person is left. 
// Legend has it that Josephus figured out where to sit to avoid being eliminated. 
// Write a Queue client Josephus that takes N and M from the command line 
// and prints out the order in which people are eliminated (and thus would show Josephus where to sit in the circle).
