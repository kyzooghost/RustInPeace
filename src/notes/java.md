Use Java for 4.1, because don't feel like I'm learning significant new things about Rust by continuing to implement solutions in Rust

For `import java_utils.Bag;` to work, need to compile import files and set CLASSPATH env:

```bash
export CLASSPATH=/Users/jefferson/Desktop/Repos/rust_education/RustInPeace/src
```

To run _4_1_3.java:

```bash
java _4_1_3.java
```
